**Abstract**: Clustering is the process of grouping similar objects together. It is a fundamental data analysis tool that has been used in many applications. However, understanding the result of a clustering algorithm is a challenging task and data analysts face this problem daily. The goal of this project was to develop a visualization technique that enabled users to understand the resulting clusters and their semantics. We focused on the analysis of hierarchical clustering, as it can be easily generalised to deal with categorical data. As the final project of CS6313 Information Visualization, we have developed ClusterVis, a tool that displays an overview of the data set and enables the exploratory analysis of each cluster, based on an information theory metric.
